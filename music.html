                Welcome to my Music Projects page! This is where I will talk about all of the fun music projects that I have worked on.
                These projects include all of the arrangements I have made and the one composition that I made for a class (I don't intend
                on writing any more compositions in the near future).
            </p>
             <p>
                On the left is a selection menu of all of my projects. As of now (5/28/2025), the projects that I am actively working on are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rosebud</li>

                This is the section where I will talk about my music background in and out of the classroom. I have done a great deal of 
                performing in my past and would like to talk about all of it here. I strongly believe that music is one of the best creative
                outlets an engineer can have, and I am very grateful for all of the opportunities that I have had simply because I learned 
                how to play the trombone.

                        Music theory is not for the weak. When signing up for Music Theory I at Purdue I was thinking "I've played an instrument
                        for 10 years of my life, this should be an easy A elective!" I was wrong. Anyway, I took it because I wanted to get better
                        at writing my own arrangements, and I needed the credit. We learned about everything, from simple rhythm notation to harmonic
                        triads to the functional harmonic paradigm and root position part writing. The final project for the course was a chorale 
                        written in the style of Bach, which is my one and only original composition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This class gave me a firm understanding of everything related to 
                        <span title="Major/minor scale based, used in the common practice era ~1600-1900AD">tonal music</span>, which will be beneficial
                        to my hobbyist level arranging. I have yet to write any arrangements since finishing the class, but I look forward to it now that 
                        I am more knowledgeable in at least *some* music theory.

                        No, I will not be taking Music Theory II, as I value my sanity and it is just a hobby.

                        Here is my only composition, the <span title="The bass voice always has the root note of the chord">root position</span> Bach
                        style chorale discussed in the above theory section. It is written in a <span title="Soprano Alto Tenor Bass">SATB</span> format,
                        and I am especially proud of the third phrase, where the alto and tenor voices trade this eighth-eighth-quarter rhythm back and
                        forth while the bass and soprano repeat the same rhythm twice around them. The chorale also makes use of a harmonic progression
                        called <i>deceptive motion</i>. Basically a <b>V</b> chord strongly wants to resolve to the <b>I</b> chord, because it contains 
                        the <span title="scale degree 7, one halfstep from the tonic note">leading tone</span> as the third, and it involves a root motion
                        of a <span title="7 halfsteps, usually the most 'perfect' sounding interval">perfect fifth</span>. Deceptive motion, however, is when the
                        <b>V</b> chord moves to the <b>vi</b> chord, which usually surprises the listener, as we are so used to the <b>V</b> to <b>I</b>
                        resolve.

                        This song is one of the most beautiful songs ever written in my opinion. Written and performed by Conor Mason, the lead singer of the 
                        modern alternative rock band Nothing But Thieves, it is the first ballad that I have ever arranged. It has a very somber melody and 
                        lyrics, as it (I think) is about being left by your partner when you're willing to work things out but they aren't interested.
                        Regardless, Conor is one of the most spectacular vocalists of all time and I am very grateful to exist on this planet at the same time
                        as him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am still working on this one, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeFEsR6uGfk">here</a> is the original song so you can see 
                        what I am talking about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have completed the first half of the song, which is a much more acoustic, piano-based portion. I have also begun the second half which
                        has a much more indie alternative feel, with lots of vocal effects and synthesized instrumentation. I am very excited to get to the final
                        chorus, as it is just as powerful as it is beautiful, and I hope to be able to captivate that in my arrangement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that excites me about this arrangement is that it is one of the first that I am making some of my own creative decisions. In
                        the past, I have mostly just been transcribing the song directly into a score without adding anything. In this arrangement however, I am
                        adding some of my own ideas. For example, after the first chorus, I move the main melody to the bass voices, which is something that I
                        have never chosen to do, and I really like how it sounds! I will publish this one and put the link here when I finish it.

                        Yeah, yeah you probably hate this song. I think its catchy and it got stuck in my head so I made an arrangement of it.
                        It is the first arrangement I had ever written with more than 4 parts, as it is a trombone ensemble arrangement meant for
                        8 trombones. It is also the only arrangement of mine that has ever been performed in front of an audience (or played by a 
                        real ensemble at all for that matter). I wrote it for a talent show fundraiser for a band honor society at Purdue, and it
                        went very well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, I am decently proud of this arrangement, but I think there were also many things that I could have done better. I 
                        was in a bit of a haste to complete it when I wrote the second half of it, so there are some notation errors and the balance
                        between parts is a little off. I don't think I will revisit this one though, as I have other scores I want to work on.

                        Out of all of the arrangements that I have completed, this is the one that I am the most proud of. It is a trombone quartet,
                        but with <span title="multiple voices on the same staff to be played by multiple players">divisis</span> included can be played
                        by 9 people without any complete overlap. This song was one of my favorites when I arranged it. Not only is the guitar riff catchy,
                        the overall song is very upbeat but has a sort of contradictory meloncholy, nostalgic feeling. I don't know how to put it to words
                        but it makes me feel like I want something but I don't know what that thing that I want is. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are certainly some rhythms that I got wrong (my dictation skills have improved in the years since I arranged this), but as I 
                        said, this is my proudest arrangement. I think I nailed the meloncholic feeling I described before while also writing parts that would
                        actually be fun to play. The biggest problem with the arrangement is that it is pretty high in terms of range, so it is probably
                        exclusive to intermediate or advanced players.

                        This is a great song from the Canadian blues-rock duo The Blue Stones. It is a very simple but effective song, which is why I was able to
                        arrange it for a trombone quartet in one night. I am pretty proud of the arrangement, however, as I think it is the most playable quartet
                        that I have written.

                    <p>
                        Like I said, I believe this to be my most playable quartet, as in it has no ridiculous range restrictions or rhythms. The greatest limiting
                        factor is the less common key signature for a trombonist, but any key signature is managable with enough practice. There are some things that
                        I would change about it if I hadn't already published it, but I think I will leave it as it is to work on other things instead.

                    <p>
                        Those who know me know that if Royal Blood has 1000 fans, I am one of them. If they have 1 fan, its me, and if they have 0 fans, I must be dead.
                        Anyway, I had to arrange a song by them, and Typhoons is one of my all time favorites. It fits that category of "really upbeat songs about really
                        sad topics", as it is a description of the many complex emotions that come with a mental health struggle, but it has a sick bass riff and a driving
                        disco-rock feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another interesting thing about this arrangement is the way I had to try to mimic the band's iconic sound. Royal Blood is a British rock duo consisting
                        of a drummer and a bassist/vocalist/pianist. No guitar. At all (except a few songs). You would think that there is a guitar, but what you hear when
                        you listen to Royal Blood is a <b>very</b> heavily distorted bass guitar, that almost sounds like a guitar and a bass playing at the same time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think I did an ok job mimicing the bass sound by doubling the riff by octave between parts, but I also feel like I was missing something with this
                        arrangement. This was my second ever arrangement, so I am happy with it nonetheless, but some parts of it feel a little empty. If I had arranged this 
                        one today, I would have figured out some sort of countermelody to add to it, but at this point of my arranging career I was too scared to do anything
                        but transcribe what I could hear.

                        This was my very first arrangement. I started arranging because I would hear songs that I wanted to play, but there would never be any parts for me to 
                        play because most music composers, arrangers, etc don't commonly go through an Arctic Monkeys phase. So I took it into my own hands and did it myself.
                        What I love about this song, other than the riff and the lyrics that make no sense, is the brief solo section.

                        As mentioned above, I love the solo section of this piece, and I am proud of how I arranged it. I made sure that all 4 parts had a solo so that the
                        melody gets passed around between all players. I think this was a really good arrangement for my first and is still one of my favorite arrangements
                        that I have written. There are of course things that I would do differently now, but I think I will leave this one as a time capsule.
