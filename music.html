                Welcome to my Music Projects page! This is where I will talk about all of the fun music projects that I have worked on.
                These projects include all of the arrangements I have made and the one composition that I made for a class (I don't intend
                on writing any more compositions in the near future).

            <p>
                This is the section where I will talk about my music background in and out of the classroom. I have done a great deal of 
                performing in my past and would like to talk about all of it here. I strongly believe that music is one of the best creative
                outlets an engineer can have, and I am very grateful for all of the opportunities that I have had simply because I learned 
                how to play the trombone.

                        Music theory is not for the weak. When signing up for Music Theory I at Purdue I was thinking "I've played an instrument
                        for 10 years of my life, this should be an easy A elective!" I was wrong. Anyway, I took it because I wanted to get better
                        at writing my own arrangements, and I needed the credit. We learned about everything, from simple rhythm notation to harmonic
                        triads to the functional harmonic paradigm and root position part writing. The final project for the course was a chorale 
                        written in the style of Bach, which is my one and only original composition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This class gave me a firm understanding of everything related to 
                        <span title="Major/minor scale based, used in the common practice era ~1600-1900AD">tonal music</span>, which will be beneficial
                        to my hobbyist level arranging. I have yet to write any arrangements since finishing the class, but I look forward to it now that 
                        I am more knowledgeable in at least *some* music theory.

                        No, I will not be taking Music Theory II, as I value my sanity and it is just a hobby.

                        Here is my only composition, the <span title="The bass voice always has the root note of the chord">root position</span> Bach
                        style chorale discussed in the above theory section. It is written in a <span title="Soprano Alto Tenor Bass">SATB</span> format,
                        and I am especially proud of the third phrase, where the alto and tenor voices trade this eighth-eighth-quarter rhythm back and
                        forth while the bass and soprano repeat the same rhythm twice around them. The chorale also makes use of a harmonic progression
                        called <i>deceptive motion</i>. Basically a <b>V</b> chord strongly wants to resolve to the <b>I</b> chord, because it contains 
                        the <span title="scale degree 7, one halfstep from the tonic note">leading tone</span> as the third, and it involves a root motion
                        of a <span title="7 halfsteps, usually the most 'perfect' interval">perfect fifth</span>. Deceptive motion, however, is when the
                        <b>V</b> chord moves to the <b>vi</b> chord, which usually surprises the listener, as we are so used to the <b>V</b> to <b>I</b>
                        resolve.

                        Unfortunately, I will not publish the actual score, as I am not sure if that will violate the syllabus for an academic integrity
                        violation. Not sure how many future Theory I students will be digging through this website, but its better safe then sorry.

            <p>
                This is the section where I will discuss all of my arrangements that I have made or that I am working on. I don't have many yet, but I 
                plan to make a ton more in the future. I use <a href="https://musescore.org/en">Musescore 4</a> to write all of my arrangements, however 
                some of my older ones were done in Musescore 3.

                        Yeah, yeah you probably hate this song. I think its catchy and it got stuck in my head so I made an arrangement of it.
                        It is the first arrangement I had ever written with more than 4 parts, as it is a trombone ensemble arrangement meant for
                        8 trombones. It is also the only arrangement of mine that has ever been performed in front of an audience (or played by a 
                        real ensemble at all for that matter). I wrote it for a talent show fundraiser for a band honor society at Purdue, and it
                        went very well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can find it published <a href="https://musescore.com/user/35747140/scores/23836348">here</a> on Musescore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, I am decently proud of this arrangement, but I think there were also many things that I could have done better. I 
                        was in a bit of a haste to complete it when I wrote the second half of it, so there are some notation errors and the balance
                        between parts is a little off. I don't think I will revisit this one though, as I have other scores I want to work on.
