                    <button onclick="descDropdown('thisweb')">Hide</button>

                </div>
                <div class="projentrycontent">
                    <p>
                        The first personal project I would like to cover is this website that you yourself are currently browsing! I decided to
                        make this website for several reasons. First, I wanted to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript in case I ever end up needing
                        to design or at least understand a website or web application in my future. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I was interested in learning how to make a website, I decided that it would also be a cool way to make a project
                        portfolio where I can yap about all of my interests. And here we are!
                    </p>
                    <h4>How did I make this website?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I made this website with GitHub Pages <small>(its <i>free</i>)</small>. To learn how to host a website from GitHub,
                        I followed <a href="https://github.com/skills/github-pages">GitHub's tutorial</a> and made a test website. This is not
                        that website, as the tutorial uses markdown formatting instead of HTML. To learn HTML, I followed 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 School's guide</a>. They have a well structured online reference as
                        well as short quizzes at the end of every chapter, which I found super helpful <small>(and its also <i>free</i>)</small>.
                        GitHub Pages requires that you push changes to main and wait for it to deploy the website again in order to see the results
                        of your changes. In order to develope the website and see changes immediately, I installed the 
                        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a> extension on VSCode, which
                        let me open any HTML file in a local server by simply right clicking it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Learning JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>
                        Another goal I had for this project was to use it as an opportunity to learn some JavaScript. I have so far accomplished
                        this by adding the scroll-to-top button in the bottom left of your screen as well as the dropdowns buttons at the top
                        of each project entry. Feel free to go to <kbd>right click > inspect element > sources > scripts.js</kbd> to see how I 
                        accomplished the creation of all of the dropdowns with one function. I'm not sure if its the best way to do it, but it
                        was my own creative solution and I am proud of it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One more thing that I have added to the site is image galleries. As of writing this, I have added one to the 
                        <a href="#minecraft">Minecraft Redstone Designs</a> and <a href="#emrick">Project Emrick</a> sections of this page.
                        These have arrow buttons below that the user can use to switch between the next or previous image in the gallery, or 
                        circle buttons that the user can use to navigate directly to the image they want to see. They work by referencing and modifying
                        the <i>section</i>Images object at the top to change the image source and image hover title to the desired one. To make the
                        functions work for all future galleries, I have created an imageMaster object that contains the gallery objects. This way, all my
                        JS functions need as an argument is the image ID (except for the selectImage function which also requires the specific destination
                        requested by the user's choice of button).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, I am not done developing this website, and I intend to learn how to make some smooth transitions next.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Pages</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are currently 3 pages on the website, and I don't plan on adding any more at the moment. First is the homepage which has the
                        short about me paragraph, personal AI use statement, etc. The next page is the Tech Projects page that you are currently reading 
                        (hello there!). Last but maybe not least depending who you ask is the Music Projects page. I wanted to make my portfolio website stand
                        out, and I thought there would be no better way to accomplish that than have an entire page dedicated to my main creative outlet, music.
                        You don't have to know anything about music to enjoy it, so I encourage you to go check it out!

                    <p>
                        This is a project that I have had brewing in my head for a while (2 years lol). I had the idea while working my first internship, right when I was 
                        getting into embedded systems, but when school and other jobs took up most of my time, I unfortunately stopped working on it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Idea</h4>
                    <p>
                        Basically, I want to modify a Nintendo Switch Dock to do a pretty <span title="2017 installment of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise">
                        <i>Breath of the Wild</i></span> (BOTW) themed light show when you dock the switch in it. I got inspiration from these cool 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtL4iKoSow0">wireless chargers</a> I saw online. So imagine that, but on the front of a Nintendo Switch 
                        console dock. This sort of thing is very fitting, as a primary game mechanic of BOTW is the tablet that Link carries with him and uses to interract 
                        with objects and gain new skills.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Progress</h4>
                    <p>
                        So far, I have bought an extra dock on Ebay, realized it was in better shape than mine, and dismantled mine instead. The dock has one main PCB, which
                        houses all of the USB and HDMI ports that can be used to connect controllers, monitors, etc. How I plan to trigger the light show is to use the status
                        light signal that is already present in the dock. The dock has a green light that turns on when the console is on and docked, so this is perfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also had to dust off my Fusion 360 skills since my internship with Wavelogix (see work projects). I will need to design and print some parts for
                        the modification to look good, including the entire front face of the dock. I have so far modeled the PCB itself, but still need to model the back half
                        of dock and design the front half, which will house the extra electronics I will be adding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What extra electronics will you be adding?" you may be asking right now. I currently plan on using a <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/">
                        Seeed Studio Xiao</a> microcontroller. It is ideal for this application due to its incredibly small size and low number of pins, as I won't require that many.
                        Other than that, I still need to select a good LED to use for the display, but that shouldn't be too hard.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="projheader">Minecraft Redstone Designs</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="projentrycontent">
                    <p>
                        In case you were not aware, the game <i>Minecraft</i> has a fully fleshed-out electrical system called redstone. In the game,
                        it is usually used for small practical things such as a button to open a door or a lever to turn on the lights in your base.
                        If you are without limitations in creative mode, however, it becomes much easier to create much larger, real world circuitry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, this always seemed too hard to figure out, so I just played the game like a normal person instead of learning digital
                        system design as a 10 year old <small>(biggest mistake of my life if you ask me)</small>. Now, however, I am <i>unemployed</i> and
                        have learned how things like Systemverilog and RTL design work, so I thought I would give it a shot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing that I did was learn some basic logic gates. These are not too hard, and usually only take up 2-blocks of space.
                        The hardest part of redstone is the fact that if you place dust (wire) next to more dust, it <b>WILL</b> connect, so you really have to
                        take advantage of the third dimension when designing circuits.
                    </p>
                    <h4>D Flip-Flop</h4>
                    <p>
                        The next thing I created was a digital flip-flop, and I wanted to do it with nothing but a gate level schematic. There are lots 
                        of nifty and compact ways to make a lot of components, but I wanted to do it the primitive way first. I constructed it with only
                        nor gates and much to my surprise, was successful on the first try. The output would only match the input if the enable signal was high
                        and would otherwise remain at its original value.
                    </p>
                    <h4>8-Bit Register</h4>
                    <p>
                        After storing one bit, I thought I would store 8. Now, however, I ditched my primitive, gate-level flip-flop and found an online example
                        of a compact and stackable one. These work by using <span title="Transfers an item to its destination upon receiving high signal">hoppers</span>
                        with outputs connected in a feedback loop. A <span title="can detect if the nearby hopper contains an item">redstone comparator</span> checks
                        if the hopper on the outside contains an item (1) or if it is empty (0). With clever block placement, you can make it so that the hoppers only
                        transfer items if the enable signal is high, just like a flip-flop. This design is stackable, so all it takes to make an 8 bit register is
                        to put 8 of these bad boys next to each other.
                    </p>
                    <h4>7-Segment Display</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is my current Minecraft project, and I have made good progress on it so far. I have created the 7 segment digit itself using redstone
                        lamps, and I have connected 16 inputs to display 0-9 and A-F on it with a flick of the lever. The next step, which I am currently working on,
                        is to make a 7 segment display decoder that will display the value in a 4 bit register on the display digit.

                strong academic integrity</strong> <small>(not trying to get in trouble)</small>. These projects come from a variety 
                of fields like RTL design, embedded systems, and software projects.

                        One of the coolest projects to have been a part of at Purdue was Project Emrick. This project is the redesign of the Purdue "All-American" Marching
                        Band's uniform lights. These lights are capable of being programmed with lightshows (similar to a drone show, but on a marching band!) for halftime
                        shows at nightgames and nighttime parades alike. As a part of the software team, I helped program the devices. One specific thing that I contributed
                        was the code for the status light on the top of each unit, that lets the user know if it is on, off, connecting to WiFi, low on battery, etc. The 
                        project had its debut with the band's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNstIQ6atBE">"Disney 101" halftime show</a> when Purdue played Oregon 
                        and definitely put up a fight (L 0-35). Other contributions that I had were related to the assembly of the devices, which were comprised of an ESP32
                        microcontroller, a small Li-ion battery, an external antenna, and the light strips (of course).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am super excited to see all of the cool things that the band does with these lights and I hope to continue to contribute to the project in the future.

                        The ASIC design lab class I took was one of the most challenging but also rewarding classes I have ever taken. Did
                        it suck all of the free time out of my life? Yes. But the feeling of making a really good Systemverilog testbench
                        to test a module that you created with a very thorough and detailed RTL diagram and see it all work (after debugging
                        of course) really made it feel worth it. That or its Stockholm syndrome take your pick
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final project for this course was a collaborative project where I teamed up with two other students and designed
                        an <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0211/k/level-two-interface/ahb-lite">AHB-lite</a> enabled USB 
                        Transceiver. My specific portion of the project was the AHB subordinate device, responsible for communicating with an 
                        SoC to operate the transceiver. Unfortunately, I cannot show my RTL, testbench, module, state
                        diagram, or waveforms for academic integrity reasons but I assure you they were <i>beautiful</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I cannot show anything, I will instead recap one design challenge that I encountered and how I solved it. 
                        In the end, my subordinate device was able to transfer data to and from the USB transceiver, and the USB data was stored in
                        a FIFO data buffer that could only communicate 1 byte to/from my device per cycle. I had to design a finite state machine 
                        to handle reads/writes of greater than 1 byte from the buffer. My initial solution was to try to stall the address phase
                        of the transaction (hready low), load the bytes into an intermediate register, then allow the data phase to happen once the 
                        data was available on hrdata. Unfortunately, this method contains an oversight in that I couldn't (reliably) pull hready low
                        before the data phase. I had to stall the data phase, and due to the pipelined nature of AHB, that meant that I needed to register
                        the old address, size, etc of the transaction because they are replaced by the information of the next transaction. So, I did 
                        just that. I registered the inputs, and if the address of a transaction indicated that it was a buffer operation, my device would
                        use those registered inputs rather than the current one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What this project did for me was demystify the process of how computers are designed. Its always very easy to assume that its
                        magic performed by someone smarter than you, but understanding even a smaller ASIC like this at the register level makes the
                        whole ordeal seem more acheivable.

                        In my microcontrollers class, I had a final project that required me to make a device using a STM32 microcontroller. My group
                        decided to make a prototype for a smart home system, complete with an alarm, thermostat, and an LCD display to communicate to 
                        the user any important information. The alarm system could be enabled and disabled with a keypad, and was set off by a hall
                        effect sensor. If the alarm was triggered, a buzzer utilizing the microcontroller's PWM would sound. The thermostat consisted of
                        a temperature sensor and a motor that served as a mock AC system. The temperature sensor was read with an ADC, and if the current
                        temperature was higher than the target temperature (specified by the user with the keypad), the motor would turn on, as you would
                        expect an automatic AC to work. Lastly, we used an SPI-enabled LCD display to display the alarm state, current temperature, and 
                        target temperature to the user.

                        In case you are unfamiliar, the JOS project is a popular way to teach operating systems at universities. Developed at MIT (I think),
                        it gives the student a skeleton of an OS that, through the course of the semester, they implement many of the fundamental properties of 
                        a modern operating system. For me, the project was split into 5 labs, in which my lab partner and I set up the bootloader, the paging
                        system for virtual memory, the user environments (processes), preemptive multitasking, and file system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JOS is coded in C, and used the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> virtual machine to run the OS on a virtual x86
                        architecture. This means that the project required a strong understanding of data structures in C, as well as a firm comprehension of 
                        assembly programming.

                        The project was as challenging as it sounds, but I left my Operating Systems class with an understanding of how computers manage many 
                        proccesses at once, how they handle memory, and how file systems work.

                        At my first internship with <a href="https://wavelogix.tech/">Wavelogix</a>, my main project was to create a "Multi-Box" that could
                        operate up to 12 of the company's innovative concrete strength sensors at once in a lab testing scenario. This was my first
                        step into the world of embedded systems, and I am still grateful for what I learned from it. It was this project that had me design
                        and solder my first ever PCB using KiCad. I also learned 3D modeling and printing from this job, which is a skill that I am excited
                        to utilize more in the future. The device utilized <a href="https://www.freertos.org/">FreeRTOS</a> on an 
                        <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32">ESP32</a> microcontroller. In operation, it would first connect to WiFi
                        before connecting to a Microsoft Azure IoTHub. This is how the device was to communicate data to a Django application where it could
                        be viewed online. Unfortunately the internship ended before we could finish the web app, but most of the physical box was completed.

                        In the summer of 2024 I interned with <a href="https://reliablemicrosystems.com/">Reliable Microsystems</a>. At Rel-Micro,
                        I was a part of the PCB design team, whose job was to create the large circuit boards that the company uses to test its 
                        radiation hardened ASICs in lab scenarios. While there, I participated in the design of 2 such PCBs, from start to finish.
                        I made diagrams to map out the signals on the die pad of the chip, as well as documented all of my changes for future reference.
                        Along with my team, we participated in multiple quality review meetings with the higher-ups of the company to ensure the PCB had
                        no issues and minimal hazards such as parasitic capacitance/inductance, as these can be detrimental in a radiation testing environment.

                    <p>
                        After completing this job, I feel like I am industry ready in terms of PCB design skills. I know KiCad like the back of my hand
                        now, and am certain that I could pick up any other PCB software very quick thanks to my experience at Rel-Micro. Another software 
                        that I was introduced to at Rel-Micro was 
                        <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/layout-design/virtuoso-layout-suite.html">Cadence Virtuoso</a> 
                        IC design software. While none of the large projects I worked on there involved Cadence, I was exposed to the software and got to
                        design and run simulations on a small transistor level schematic that I made.
