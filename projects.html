                Welcome to my projects page! This is where I will outline any of my fun projects that I have completed or am currently 
                working on.

            <h2 id="personal" class="header">Personal Projects</h2>
            <p>
                In this section I will talk about all of the fun personal projects that I have been working on or have completed
                in my free time. Some of the projects that I have planned are very exciting and I am looking forward to filling this 
                section in.
            </p>

            <div class = projentry>
                <h3 id="thisweb" class="projheader">This Website</h3>
                <p>
                    The first personal project I would like to cover is this website that you yourself are currently browsing! I decided to
                    make this website for several reasons. First, I wanted to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript in case I ever end up needing
                    to design or at least understand a website or web application in my future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I was interested in learning how to make a website, I decided that it would also be a cool way to make a project
                    portfolio where I can yap about all of my interests. And here we are!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made this website with GitHub Pages <small>(its <i>free</i>)</small>. To learn how to host a website from GitHub,
                    I followed <a href="https://github.com/skills/github-pages">GitHub's tutorial</a> and made a test website. This is not
                    that website, as the tutorial uses markdown formatting instead of HTML. To learn HTML, I followed 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 School's guide</a>. They have a well structured online reference as
                    well as short quizzes at the end of every chapter, which I found super helpful <small>(and its also <i>free</i>)</small>.
                    GitHub Pages requires that you push changes to main and wait for it to deploy the website again in order to see the results
                    of your changes. In order to develope the website and see changes immediately, I installed the 
                    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a> extension on VSCode, which
                    let me open any HTML file in a local server by simply right clicking it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have added some Javascript code to the website (that nifty scroll to top button in the bottom left) One thing that 
                    I would like to add is a collapsible navigation bar, or perhaps some other smooth transitions, so I will continue to 
                    update the website as time goes on.
                </p>

            <p>
                In this section I will cover various projects that I have completed <strong>while maintaining 
                strong academic integrity</strong> <small>(not trying to get in trouble)</small>. These projects come from a variety 
                of fields like RTL design, embedded systems, and software projects.
            </p>

            <div class="projentry">
                <h3 id="USBTrans" class="projheader">USB Transceiver</h3>
                <p>
                    The ASIC design lab class I took was one of the most challenging but also rewarding classes I have ever taken. Did
                    it suck all of the free time out of my life? Yes. But the feeling of making a really good Systemverilog testbench
                    to test a module that you created with a very thorough and detailed RTL diagram and see it all work (after debugging
                    of course) really made it feel worth it. That or its Stockholm syndrome take your pick
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final project for this course was a collaborative project where I teamed up with two other students and designed
                    an <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0211/k/level-two-interface/ahb-lite">AHB-lite</a> enabled USB 
                    Transceiver. My specific portion of the project was the AHB subordinate device, responsible for communicating with an 
                    SoC to operate the transceiver. Unfortunately, I cannot show my RTL, testbench, module, state
                    diagram, or waveforms for academic integrity reasons but I assure you they were <i>beautiful</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I cannot show anything, I will instead recap one design challenge that I encountered and how I solved it. 
                    In the end, my subordinate device was able to transfer data to and from the USB transceiver, and the USB data was stored in
                    a FIFO data buffer that could only communicate 1 byte to/from my device per cycle. I had to design a finite state machine 
                    to handle reads/writes of greater than 1 byte from the buffer. My initial solution was to try to stall the address phase
                    of the transaction (hready low), load the bytes into an intermediate register, then allow the data phase to happen once the 
                    data was available on hrdata. Unfortunately, this method contains an oversight in that I couldn't (reliably) pull hready low
                    before the data phase. I had to stall the data phase, and due to the pipelined nature of AHB, that meant that I needed to register
                    the old address, size, etc of the transaction because they are replaced by the information of the next transaction. So, I did 
                    just that. I registered the inputs, and if the address of a transaction indicated that it was a buffer operation, my device would
                    use those registered inputs rather than the current one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What this project did for me was demystifying the process of how computers are designed. Its always very easy to assume that its
                    magic performed by someone smarter than you, but understanding even a smaller ASIC like this at the register level makes the
                    whole ordeal seem more acheivable

                <h3 id="smarthome" class="projheader">Smart Home System</h3>
                <p>
                    In my microcontrollers class, I had a final project that required me to make a device using a STM32 microcontroller. My group
                    decided to make a prototype for a smart home system, complete with an alarm, thermostat, and an LCD display to communicate to 
                    the user any important information. The alarm system could be enabled and disabled with a keypad, and was set off by a hall
                    effect sensor. If the alarm was triggered, a buzzer utilizing the microcontroller's PWM would sound. The thermostat consisted of
                    a temperature sensor and a motor that served as a mock AC system. The temperature sensor was read with an ADC, and if the current
                    temperature was higher than the target temperature (specified by the user with the keypad), the motor would turn on, as you would
                    expect an automatic AC to work. Lastly, we used an SPI-enabled LCD display to display the alarm state, current temperature, and 
                    target temperature to the user.

                This section covers projects that I have completed at past jobs. I won't go into a ton of detail on these, as my past internships
                are well detailed in my resume and on my LinkedIn (see footer for link).

                <h3 id="multibox" class="projheader">Multi-Box V2</h3>
                <p>
                    At my first internship with <a href="https://wavelogix.tech/">Wavelogix</a>, my main project was to create a "Multi-Box" that could
                    operate up to 12 of the company's innovative concrete strength sensors at once in a lab testing scenario. This was my first
                    step into the world of embedded systems, and I am still grateful for what I learned from it. It was this project that had me design
                    and solder my first ever PCB using KiCad. I also learned 3D modeling and printing from this job, which is a skill that I am excited
                    to utilize more in the future. The device utilized <a href="https://www.freertos.org/">FreeRTOS</a> on an 
                    <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32">ESP32</a> microcontroller. In operation, it would first connect to WiFi
                    before connecting to a Microsoft Azure IoTHub. This is how the device was to communicate data to a Django application where it could
                    be viewed online. Unfortunately the internship ended before we could finish the web app, but most of the physical box was completed.
