                Welcome to my projects page! This is where I will outline any of my fun projects that I have completed or am currently 
                working on.

            <h2 id="personal" class="header">Personal Projects</h2>
            <p>
                In this section I will talk about all of the fun personal projects that I have been working on or have completed
                in my free time. Some of the projects that I have planned are very exciting and I am looking forward to filling this 
                section in.
            </p>

            <div class = projentry>
                <h3 id="thisweb" class="projheader">This Website</h3>
                <p>
                    The first personal project I would like to cover is this website that you yourself are currently browsing! I decided to
                    make this website for several reasons. First, I wanted to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript in case I ever end up needing
                    to design or at least understand a website or web application in my future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I was interested in learning how to make a website, I decided that it would be a cool way to make a project
                    portfolio where I can yap about all of my interests. And here we are!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made this website with GitHub Pages <small>(its <i>free</i>)</small>. To learn how to host a website from GitHub,
                    I followed <a href="https://github.com/skills/github-pages">GitHub's tutorial</a> and made a test website. This is not
                    that website, as the tutorial uses markdown formatting instead of HTML. To learn HTML, I followed 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 School's guide</a>. They have a well structured online reference as
                    well as short quizzes at the end of every chapter, which I found super helpful <small>(and its also <i>free</i>)</small>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I intend to keep working on this site to make it look prettier and also involve some Javascript somewhere. One thing that 
                    I would like to add is a collapsible navigation bar, or perhaps some other smooth transitions.
                </p>

                In this section I will cover various projects that I have completed <strong>while maintaining 
                strong academic integrity</strong> <small>(not trying to get in trouble)</small>. These projects come from a variety 
                of fields like RTL design, embedded systems, and software projects.
            </p>
            <h2 id="work" class="header">Work Projects</h2>
            <p>
                This section covers projects that I have completed at past jobs.
