# Grant Sylvester's Web Portfolio

## Intro

This project is a personal undertaking of mine to create a project portfolio to talk about my interests, as well as projects that I
am unable to fit on my resume. I am using it as a way to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and (maybe) Javascript. The website is also meant
to be a more light-hearted, less professional sounding portfolio.
