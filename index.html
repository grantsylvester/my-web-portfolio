        <p>
            Hello! My name is Grant, and I am an undergraduate in computer engineering with a concentration
            in computer systems at Purdue University.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header">My Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I have a passion for all things electronics. I have experience in many areas ranging from embedded systems, arduino and 
            microcontrollers to semiconductors and ASIC design. Another major part of my life is music. I play the trombone, but I also 
            enjoy arranging my favorites songs on on Musescore in my free time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header">Why Have I made this Website?</h2>
        <p>
            My reason for creating this webpage is to be able to have a less serious place to show off my projects. Don't get me 
            wrong, LinkedIn is great, but sometimes its nicer to have a way to informally talk about my passion projects.
        </p>
