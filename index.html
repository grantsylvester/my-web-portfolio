            <p>
                Hello! My name is Grant, and I am an undergraduate in computer engineering with a concentration
                in computer systems at Purdue University.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I have a passion for all things electronics. I have experience in many areas ranging from embedded systems, arduino and 
                microcontrollers to semiconductors and ASIC design. Another major part of my life is music. I play the trombone, but I also 
                enjoy arranging my favorites songs on on Musescore in my free time. Both of these parts of my life are highlighted by this
                website.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">Why have I made this Website?</h2>
            <p>
                My reason for creating this webpage is to be able to have a less serious place to show off my projects. Don't get me 
                wrong, LinkedIn is great, but sometimes its nicer to have a way to informally talk about my passion projects. If you want 
                to read more about this website and how I created it, navigate to the Tech Projects page to do so, and check out my other 
                projects while you're there! I have also created a Music Projects page to talk about my musical background
                as well as the arrangements that I have written.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">My Personal AI Policy</h2>
            <p>
                The whole point of me taking on all of these personal projects is for me to learn new skills myself. With that in mind, I have not
                and will not ever use code generated by an LLM for any of my projects. I will reference online sources to learn how to write my own
                code and nothing else. However, I understand that knowing how to properly use AI is an important skill itself, so I will (when I am
                particularly stuck on something) ask AI for tips, but NEVER copy/paste ANY generated code. I take pride in accomplishing things on
                my own, and to me the rewarding feeling of completing a project is partially lost if half the code was AI generated.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">What is my Favorite Color?</h2>
            <p>
                Maroon, can't you tell?
            </p>
