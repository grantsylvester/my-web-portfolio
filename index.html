                Hello! My name is Grant, and I am an undergraduate in computer engineering with a concentration
                in computer systems at Purdue University.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I have a passion for all things electronics. I have experience in many areas ranging from embedded systems, arduino and 
                microcontrollers to semiconductors and ASIC design. Another major part of my life is music. I play the trombone, but I also 
                enjoy arranging my favorites songs on on Musescore in my free time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">Why have I made this Website?</h2>
            <p>
                My reason for creating this webpage is to be able to have a less serious place to show off my projects. Don't get me 
                wrong, LinkedIn is great, but sometimes its nicer to have a way to informally talk about my passion projects.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">What is my Favorite Color?</h2>
            <p>
                Maroon, can't you tell?
            </p>
