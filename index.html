        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Grant, and I am a computer engineering undergraduate student at Purdue University.
        </p>
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I have a passion for all things electronics. I have experience in many areas ranging from embedded systems, arduino and 
            microcontrollers to semiconductors and ASIC design. Another major part of my life is music. I play the trombone, but I also 
            enjoy arranging my favorites songs on on Musescore in my free time.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Have I made this Website?</h2>
        <p>
            My reason for creating this webpaage is to be able to have a less serious place to show off my projects. Don't get me 
            wrong, LinkedIn is great, but sometimes its nicer to have a way to informally talk about my passion projects.
