            <p>
                Hello! My name is Grant, and I am an undergraduate in computer engineering with a concentration
                in computer systems at Purdue University.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I have a passion for all things electronics. I have experience in many areas ranging from embedded systems, arduino and 
                microcontrollers to semiconductors and ASIC design. Another major part of my life is music. I play the trombone, but I also 
                enjoy arranging my favorites songs on on Musescore in my free time. Both of these parts of my life are highlighted by this
                website. If you want to read more about this website and how I created it, navigate to the Tech Projects page to do so, and
                check out my other projects while you're there! I have also created a Music Projects page to talk about my musical background
                as well as the arrangements that I have written.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">Why have I made this Website?</h2>
            <p>
                My reason for creating this webpage is to be able to have a less serious place to show off my projects. Don't get me 
                wrong, LinkedIn is great, but sometimes its nicer to have a way to informally talk about my passion projects.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">My Personal AI Policy</h2>
            <p>
                The whole point of me taking on all of these personal projects is for me to learn new skills myself. That being said, I have not
                and will not ever use code generated by an LLM for any of my projects. I will reference online sources to learn how to write my own
                code and nothing else. However, I understand that knowing how to properly use AI is an important skill itself, so I will (when I am
                particularly stuck on something) ask AI for tips, but NEVER copy/paste ANY generated code.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">What is my Favorite Color?</h2>
            <p>
                Maroon, can't you tell?
            </p>
